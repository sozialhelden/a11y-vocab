# Backward Compatibility

We propose to change the following things:

* Change object of relation `:accessMode` - `:domainIncludes` from `:CreativeWork` to `:Thing`. 
* Change object of relation `:accessModeSufficient` - `:domainIncludes` from `:CreativeWork` to `:Thing`. 
* Change object of relation `:accessibilitySummary` - `:domainIncludes` from `:CreativeWork` to `:Thing`.
