        Describes a physical entrance to a [[Place]].
        If a [[Thing]] is used as an entrance or exit, this type can be combined as multi-type entity with other types like [[Door]], [[Elevator]], [[Escalator]], or [[Ramp]].
        An [[EntranceOrExit]] SHOULD have a name property with the name of the entrance if there are multiple entrances to the same place.
        If one or more physical sign(s) exist for the entrance, the value of name SHOULD correspond to what is readable on the sign(s).
